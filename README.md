# Intro to Applied Data Science Project 2

## Description

This is a web application built with a React frontend and FastAPI + Python backend. It allows users to compare two PDF documents using OpenAI's ChatGPT.
It is intended for use by urban planners and other professionals in assessing bid responses to a Request for Proposal (RFP).
PDF files are parsed locally using PyPDF.
Users can freely use my code and deploy their own version, but will need an OpenAI API key to do so.
